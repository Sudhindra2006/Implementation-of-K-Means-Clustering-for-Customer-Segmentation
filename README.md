# Implementation-of-K-Means-Clustering-for-Customer-Segmentation

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the K Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Import pandas and matplotlib.pyplot
2.Read the dataset and transform it
3.Import KMeans and fit the data in the model
4.plot the cluster graph
